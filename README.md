- 👋 Hi, I’m @TaiChiYouth
- 👀 I’m interested in building an ONLINE school for troubled youth, teens, young adults (we had senior programs).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning L.M.S. web building Learning Management System school construction.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a DAO for Tai Chi Youth, a DAO board of Trustees, fundraising, coins, NFTs and blockchain events... 
- 📫 How to reach me: RichardDelConnor@gmail.com 

Tai Chi Youth was founded in 1996 after I'd proven the benefits of our traditional Yang Tai Chi Chuan and Northern Shaolin Kung Fu curriculums in a maximum security youth prison and drug rehab centers...
I am Richard Del Connor and was trained by Grandmaster Wong Jack Man who fought Bruce Lee in 1964 (the movies are all unrealistic) and certified me in 1994 as a Chinese JingMo school as seen in the Jet Li movie, "Fearless."

I am 86 years old and need to pass on my wisdom in VIDEOS within an ONLINE school to continue benefitting youth and young adults in the future... and when we populate other planets...
